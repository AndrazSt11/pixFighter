Intro into game: 

You have found yourself in a strange place called Emiphia. No foreigners are allowed, so everyone that sees you is attacking you, so you have to fight back if you want to survive. But remember, you'll have to be very careful! The enemies are very powerful, so you'll have to be very strong to get them all to get out of Emiphia. Do it as fast as you can to gain more poins. GOOD LUCK!
